# Code style

We are somewhat relaxed about code style, but in general we use the following conventions:

- Use PEP 8 conventions, for example:
  - Spaces around operators, except `**`. But not around parentheses.
  - No spaces around '=' when passing kwargs to functions.
- Google style docstrings.
